# TaskManager
UWP application developed in C#

Phase 1: Beginnings of the C# console app. Console application was created and the user is able to do the following.
Create a new task
Delete an existing task
Edit an existing task
Complete a task
List all outstanding (not complete) tasks
List all tasks.

Phase 2: Building upon the intiial application the concept of inheritance was implemented. Task and appointment classes were dervived from an "item" class.
Each had different properties to differentiate them. 
A search function was implemented as well.

Phase 3: The application now uses a graphical interface. All previous functionality was carried over, with the ability to prioritize 
the appointments and tasks.

Phase 4: Integration of a web API. The project was split into two (one for the API and one for client application).
Tasks and Appointments can be pushed and pulled from the web API.
